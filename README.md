# TEXTUAL-ANALYSIS-FOR-DIFFERENT-VARIABLE-COUNTS-


PROJECT DETAILS:-
I was asked to extract the beautiful insights from the URL data provided by them, which included web links of the article.
so the task was to extract the text from the web links and do textual analysis over the extracted text and calculate the various variable counts using python programming and
save the extracted output in the form of excel file .
